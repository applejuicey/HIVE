                I majored in preventive medicine as an undergraduate. Currently, I am studying and researching in epidemiology&health statistics as a medicine master candidate (mainly on Bayesian methods in clinical trials). With a great interest in computer science, I have been learning by myself programming languages and accomplished several projects in which web applications serving for clinical trials were developed and deployed into production. As my training into the field goes further, I find the attractions as well as the necessities of learning AI techniques and implementing them into healthcare.

                My career prospect is to develop a progressive web application providing information for individuals on their health states, for healthcare practitioners on assisting them with disease diagnosis, and for administrative bodies on public health monitoring and policymaking. The PWA can run on any internet-connected device with a browser. It should be capable of collecting, storing and analysing data from electronic health records as well as crowdsourced information based on people’s consent. Machine learning techniques should be implemented, for example, to improve data entry efficiency, to process unstructured data, to predict disease&prognosis and to monitor epidemics.

                The motivation sprouted in the fourth year of my undergraduate study (2015) when I was a rotating intern in a hospital. I saw clinicians recording patients’ data in spreadsheets for scientific study purpose (some even kept them in paper notebooks). Whenever they consulted me on statistical methods about their research, they struggled in the data visualisation and processing procedure. As a result, I chose to develop an online data capture system to solve the pains. Although the system contributed well in dealing with the data storing and querying difficulties, problems still existed. For example, in the blind-review process of clinical trials, when it came to the unstructured data, human labour/wisdom was indispensable in the understanding and classifying work. Moreover, clinicians had minimal time to re-enter these data (from health records to EDC), and they considered it as repetitive, tedious work which alternatively should be accomplished by computers extracting and parsing correctly and intelligently. As I come to know about AI and what AI can do for us, the thoughts that the data entry system should be empowered with AI techniques (e.g. OCR, NLP, voice recognition) gradually formalise.

                The experiences of researching in the area of epidemiology and health statistics reinforce my AI motivations. Through the statistical consultancy work, I find that clinicians expect to translate their data into routine use and even into commercialisation. I am working on a web app where information can be inputted and then the probability of a specific disease or prognosis will be returned based on previously stored data. Usually, simple regressions are eligible, but sometimes particular limitations have to be considered, and more sophisticated statistical techniques (e.g. generalised additive models, Bayesian methods) are required. After trying a ‘hello-world-level’ example of machine learning in diagnosing breast cancer via health records, I was attracted by the simplicity but its potential in the prediction and classification. It feels like peeping through a hole on a gate behind which is a new world, and I am eager to step into it now.

                Seven years ago, when I just started to major in preventive medicine, I had no idea of what it was about and what my career should be, and undoubtedly, I screwed up some exams. With the increment of my knowledge on the discipline, I felt the necessities to re-consolidate the fundamental subjects. It was through an online course on coursera.org in 2017 (Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization) that I knew about ICL for the first time. I appreciated the valuable lessons by the ICL instructors and impressed by their dark circles around eyes.

                During the years, I have been equipping myself with medical and statistical knowledge, as well as programming skills and software development experiences. Now I am seeking for an opportunity to complete the AI part for my career and, excitingly, I found the website ai4health.io this summer. There is no chance for another more suitable training programme. The group’s idea that AI can one day help solve problems which require human intelligence now precisely reflects how my cognition and resolution of applying AI to healthcare shapes gradually as I go deep into the domain step by step. Besides, being a  cross-disciplinary student, I do believe I will take to it like a duck to water for the AI4Health CDT training, which features interdisciplinary supervisory system as well as a three-phase research schedule. I know the importance of interaction between subjects to the whole research procedure from idea to application. And I’d be glad if my experiences would be of help to the centre in case of developing health-related apps. I know there is no highway towards a PhD, but it is the process of pushing on this unpaved track that fascinates me and presents my value. I have faith in achieving my career goals with myself one day but never can I reach the height nor efficiency I would have with the cultivation from the AI4Health CDT.
