                I majored in preventive medicine as an undergraduate. Currently, I am studying and researching on epidemiology&health statistics as a medicine master candidate. Before entering university, I thought the most desirable career for me is to practise medicine because saving lives seemed to be the most honourable and meaningful thing in the world. However, my mind was changing gradually with the increment of my knowledge on the discipline, from which I knew there are things more important than saving a patient. Therefore, I determined to be a practitioner of public health, researching on statistical methodology and application for health promotion.

                It was during an internship in a hospital in 2015 that I came up with some ideas of my career for the first time. When I rotated to the department of medical record managing, I was astonished by the massive amount of paper medical records stored there. I couldn't help wondering the value as well as the feasibility of exploring the potential information buried in these seldom-touched data. However, I knew the difficulties in digitalising and applying proper techniques to analyse them. With the increasing prevalence of electronic health data capturing/storage and the idea of real-world studies, I feel the chance. How to make use of these original real-world data, how to employ appropriate statistical methods for analysis, how to draw reliable conclusions and scientifically guide health interventions are what I am eager to do.

                During my master degree, I have participated in several clinical trials and became familiar with SAS programming in data processing and statistical analysis. Besides, because of my current tutor's mathematics background, I was asked to sit in on many mathematical courses (e.g. probability theory, mathematical statistics, linear algebra), which made it easier for me to understand the methodologies. To know more about this new and promising field, I joined meetings and discussions on real-world study methods as well as research progress on traditional Chinese medicine.

                Not only am I a passionate learner, but also I am willing to bring the techniques into practical application. I have taken part in several projects collaborated with traditional Chinese medicine researchers and clinicians who are interested in dealing with the health data collected from routine patient treatments. Propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting were employed to help a paediatrician remove the imbalance caused by covariates such as gestation ages and weights. Cox regression and nomogram were tried to support an oncologist screen the risk factors of lung cancer and predict patient prognosis. Assisting them with their researches also made me proficient at R programming. Moreover, my master thesis aims at implementing machine learning algorithms (BP neural network and support vector machine) to predict the prognosis of major depressive disorder based on demographic, clinical and genetic data collected from patients in the Department of Psychosomatics and Psychiatry of the affiliated hospital, and to compare the prediction accuracy of each model. For the moment, I am trying these AI techniques on routinely collected data, intending to inspire to-be-tested hypotheses that are hoped to improve health interventions and to benefit more real-world individuals.

                As a half-way seeker of knowledge, I am thrilled to find that Professor Sabine Landau has such an exciting project (Bridging the gap between trials and impact on patients in mental health: generalising trial findings using routinely collected data). I pay attention to accumulate clinical, epidemiological and statistical knowledge in daily studying and researching, which are all needed to carry out the PhD training programme. Besides, her proficiency in clinical trials and causal inference will be of excellent guidance if I had the good fortune to do a doctorate there. Of course, I'd be glad if I could provide support in the research and trial work.

                Indeed, I admit that studying for a PhD degree is a long and tough journey, but I know I am well prepared. I want to be one of the vanguards fighting for a better world, and I do believe that under the training of your department will I reach my full potentials. Anyhow, I will always expect for the best and prepare for the worst, carrying out my PhD research down to the ground step by step.
